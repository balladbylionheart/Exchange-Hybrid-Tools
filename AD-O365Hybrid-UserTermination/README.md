# **AD O365 Hybrid User Termination**

By Helen Najar, Lionheart | Ballad by Lionheart

## **Overview**

This PowerShell script simplifies the termination process for user accounts in a hybrid Active Directory (AD) and Exchange Online environment.
A graceful script forged to ease the final steps of user offboarding, preserving order in both cloud and realm.

## **Key Functions**

* Validates user existence in AD.
* Resets the user‚Äôs password.
* Converts the mailbox to a shared mailbox and hides it from address lists.
* Clears calendar events organized by the user.
* Removes all AD group memberships (except the primary group).
* Updates the user‚Äôs AD description with termination details.
* Disables the AD account and moves it to a designated ‚ÄúDisabled‚Äù Organizational Unit (OU).
* Prompts for and validates a ticket number (e.g., `REQ1234567`) to document the action.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Customization Required**

The following placeholders **must be updated** for your environment:

* `skystar.com` ‚Üí Replace with your organization‚Äôs email domain
* `Disabled Sync, OU=Disabled Objects` ‚Üí Match your actual AD structure

üìå If these are not updated, the script may not work correctly.
